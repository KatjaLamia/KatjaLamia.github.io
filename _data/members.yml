  description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. \
        He was introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, \
        where he was a research assistant in [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/)’s laboratory. In 2014, he received \
        his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the direction of [Dr. Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). \
        As a graduate student, Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a \
        key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” \
        As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, he is developing new methods that combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved \
        structural measurements to provide detailed insight into the conformational landscapes of biological macromolecules. These new methods are being applied to understand how \
        protein function is modulated by genetic mutations, by interactions with other molecules, and by other physical stimuli. \


        Since joining the Fraser lab in 2014, Mike has been supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](http://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), \
        a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/)."

        oxygenic photosynthesis using X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) diffraction. He worked with the Sauter group \

        at XFEL experiments, and with the Yano/Yachandra group to solve several of the first high-resolution room \
        temperature structures and the first high-resolution transient state structures of photosystem II, revealing \
        the sequence of changes at the heterometallic cluster that catalyzes oxygen evolution. As a postdoc with the \
        Fraser group, he is collaborating with the developers of the cisTEM software for macromolecular structure \

        heterogeneous ribosomes, with implications for regulation of the proteome at the stage of translation.
