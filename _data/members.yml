  description: "Vivian is a postdoctoral fellow at the Wiseman lab. Her work is focused on defining how the mitochondrial protease YME1L regulates mitochondrial proteostasis and how this protease promotes the site-specific processing of the GTPase OPA1 required for efficient mitochondrial function. She is also working on developing small-molecule activators of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) in order to reduce pathologic protein aggregation and mitochondrial damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Vivian is from Brazil and earned her Ph.D. and Master’s degree in Biosystems at the Federal University of ABC. During her Ph.D. she studied the cytotoxicity of pro-apoptotic compounds in tumor cells and she was also awarded a 1-year fellowship to perform part of her work at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. In addition, Vivian also holds a Pharm.D. degree from the University of Mogi das Cruzes and worked as a pharmacist for two years prior to her graduate training. Besides her work in the lab, Vivian enjoys going to the gym, hiking and spending her time at the beach. She also loves travelling and baking.


  Vivian is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the George Hewitt foundation."

  description: "Jessica is a graduate student in the Wiseman lab studying the mechanisms by which pharmacologic modulators of ATF6 protect against ischemia / reperfusion injury. Her initial studies focused on neuroprotective mechanisms and she is currently looking at the role of ATF6 in inflammatory signaling. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Washington and Lee University, where she studied the population dynamics of Virginia sneezeweed as well as brook trout using genetic markers. She also holds a Master of Science degree in Pharmacy from the University of Florida, which she earned while identifying missing US service members as a forensic DNA analyst at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory. She later served as the Sequencing Project Coordinator at the National Institutes of Health Sequencing Center. In addition to her graduate studies at Scripps Research, she actively participates in outreach and philanthropy events and brings her dog Elsie to lab most days. Outside of the lab she enjoys boxing and gardening."

She is also responsible for performing the mass spectrometry experiments for the Wiseman Lab. Initially during her rotation, she worked with Bibiana Rius Ph.D. to study the mechanism of how pharmacologic activators of ATF6 reduce secretion of amyloidogenic light-chain in light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Human Biology from the University of California, San Diego. During her undergraduate studies she worked under Supriya Srinivasan Ph.D. at Scripps Research to help study the underlying neuronal mechanisms by which C. elegans regulate peripheral lipid metabolism. After graduating from UCSD, Jaleh joined the lab of Jeffery Kelly Ph.D. at Scripps Research to help define disease biomarkers for Transthyretin-related familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients from Portugal. Outside of lab, Jaleh enjoys rock climbing and playing video games."
