  description: "Jessica is a third year graduate student studying the mechanisms by which pharmacologic modulators of ATF6 protect against ischemia / reperfusion injury. Her initial studies focused on neuroprotective mechanisms and she is currently looking at the role of ATF6 in inflammatory signaling. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Washington and Lee University, where she studied the population dynamics of Virginia sneezeweed as well as brook trout using genetic markers. She also holds a Master of Science degree in Pharmacy from the University of Florida, which she earned while identifying missing US service members as a forensic DNA analyst at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory. She later served as the Sequencing Project Coordinator at the National Institutes of Health Sequencing Center. In addition to her graduate studies at Scripps Research, she actively participates in outreach and philanthropy events and brings her dog Elsie to lab most days. Outside of the lab she enjoys boxing and gardening."

  description: "Mike's longstanding research interest lies in understanding how proteins function by dynamically interconverting between different conformational states. \
        He was introduced to structural biology and X-ray crystallography as an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, \
        where he was a research assistant in [Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/)’s laboratory. In 2014, he received \
        his Ph.D. in [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology](http://bmsb.chem.ucla.edu/) from UCLA under the direction of [Dr. Todd Yeates](http://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu/). \
        As a graduate student, Mike investigated the role of conformational polymorphism in expanding the functional diversity of a \
        key family of proteins that define a widespread class of prokaryotic organelles collectively known as “bacterial microcompartments.” \
        As a postdoc in the Fraser Lab, he is developing new methods that combine temperature perturbations with static and time-resolved \
        structural measurements to provide detailed insight into the conformational landscapes of biological macromolecules. These new methods are being applied to understand how \
        protein function is modulated by genetic mutations, by interactions with other molecules, and by other physical stimuli. \


        Since joining the Fraser lab in 2014, Mike has been supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [BioXFEL Science and Technology Center](http://www.bioxfel.org/) (NSF), \
        a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NHLBI](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/), and an Independent Postdoctoral Research Award from the [UCSF Program in Breakthrough Biomedical Research (PBBR)](http://pbbr.ucsf.edu/)."

        microscopy. He earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from UC Berkeley working with Drs. Junko Yano, Vittal Yachandra \
        and Nick Sauter at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on discovery of the mechanism of water splitting in \
        oxygenic photosynthesis using X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) diffraction. He worked with the Sauter group \
        to develop XFEL diffraction data processing methods, including the cctbx.xfel program for real-time feedback \
        at XFEL experiments, and with the Yano/Yachandra group to solve several of the first high-resolution room \
        temperature structures and the first high-resolution transient state structures of photosystem II, revealing \
        the sequence of changes at the heterometallic cluster that catalyzes oxygen evolution. As a postdoc with the \
        Fraser group, he is collaborating with the developers of the cisTEM software for macromolecular structure \
        determination by cryo-electron microscopy to improve recovery of flexible molecular motions with this \
        technique. This project aims to determine the mechanism of transcript-dependent but sequence-independent \
        translational efficiency of a pool of naturally occurring, compositionally and conformationally \
        heterogeneous ribosomes, with implications for regulation of the proteome at the stage of translation.
