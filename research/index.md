# The Wiseman lab: Defining the pathologic and therapeutic impact of stress-responsive signaling in diverse diseases:

#   



## *What are we doing?*

Our bodies are constantly challenged with a wide array of genetic, environmental or aging-related insults (or stress). These stresses including everything from eating a sandwich to simply getting older. To confront these challenges, our bodies utilize a network of stress-responsive signaling pathways that protect our cells from these various types of insults. These pathways all work through a generalizable mechanism involving the sensing of a particular type of stress and the activation of signaling cascades that promote transcriptional and/or translational remodeling of the cell proteome. These pathways are continuously signaling to mitigate damage associated with the constantly changing cellular environment. Considering the importance of stress-signaling pathways in maintaining cellular and organismal function, it is not surprising that genetic or aging-associated changes in stress-responsive signaling pathways are implicated in the onset and pathogenesis of many different diseases. Our interests primarily focus on defining the pathologic implications of stress-responsive signaling pathways in different diseases with the explicit goal of identifying potential aspects of the endogenous pathways that can be therapeutically targeted to improve outcomes across many disorders. In other words, we are looking to identify ways to ‘hijack’ our body’s own defense mechanisms to prevent pathological imbalances in cellular physiology associated with diverse diseases.

We primarily focus on studying stress-responsive signaling pathways involved in regulating protein homeostasis (or proteostasis) such as the unfolded protein response (UPR), integrated stress response (ISR), and heat shock response (HSR). These pathways function to maintain the integrity of the cellular proteome and prevent the potentially toxic accumulation of proteins that can disrupt cellular physiology. Imbalances in proteostasis are implicated in many different diseases including cardiovascular disorders, protein misfolding diseases, diabetes and many neurodegenerative diseases. As we focus on defining the specific mechanisms by which stress-responsive proteostasis pathways protect cells against disease-relevant insults, we are identifying new opportunities to mitigate pathologies associated with etiologically-diverse diseases. In other words, we are developing a single strategy that can potentially be widely applied to treat multiple types of disease in a ‘one-drug:multiple disease’ therapeutic paradigm.  


## *How are we doing this?*

We are developing novel chemical genetic and pharmacologic approaches to activate stress-responsive proteostasis pathways independent of cell stress. Using these approaches, we can determine the specific importance of a pathway on cellular physiology and define the therapeutic potential for activating this pathway in models of different diseases. We have developed ligand-regulated approaches that are now widely being used by the research community to selectively activate different stress responsive signaling pathways including the HSR and UPR. Furthermore, we have identified and stringently characterized first-in-class compounds that activate specific protective aspects of UPR signaling. Using these compounds, we are actively defining the ability to mitigate pathologic imbalances in proteostasis associated with multiple diseases including systemic amyloid diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, eye diseases (with the [Lin lab](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/pathology/research/labs/lin/Pages/default.aspx) at UCSD), cardiovascular diseases (with the [Glembotski lab](http://www.bio.sdsu.edu/Pub/glembotski/) at SDSU), diabetes (with the [Saez lab](https://www.scripps.edu/saez/lab_members.html) at Scripps), and many more. Specific compounds found to be broadly beneficial across these diseases are being further developed in collaboration with the [Kelly lab](https://www.scripps.edu/kelly/) at Scripps.

Apart from our development of strategies to reduce proteostasis imbalances in disease, we are also interested in improving our understanding of how stress-responsive proteostasis pathways regulate different aspects of cellular physiology, most notably mitochondrial function. We an active program specifically focused on how stress-responsive proteostasis pathways such as the ISR regulate diverse aspects of mitochondrial biology including proteostasis, morphology, and energy metabolism. Moreover, we have established a highly productive structural collaboration with the [Lander lab](http://www.lander-lab.com/) at Scripps directed towards establishing the molecular basis for mitochondrial proteostasis regulation. Through these efforts, we are identifying new potential opportunities to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction in disease by targeting stress-responsive proteostasis pathways.  


## *What are we finding?*

Finally, although these biophysical techniques generate beautiful images of electron density maps and NMR spectra, we use a variety of assays to test the importance of alternative conformations and protein motions. We study the role of protein motions in enzyme catalysis using directed evolution screens and selections.  In collaboration with Tanja Kortemme’s lab, we test the ability of protein design approaches to generate rescue mutants and create novel functions. We investigate the consequences of altering biophysical parameters in the context of living systems using high-throughput genetic screens pioneered by our collaborator Nevan Krogan.  These approaches reveal extensive parallels that scale from systems biology to atomic mechanisms in how we understand genetic non-additivity, buffering, and robustness.  We believe this “systems to structure” approach will be essential for elucidating disease mechanisms in the age of personal genomics.  

The long-term goals of our research are: 1) to develop fundamental biophysical methods and 2) to apply these methods to define the role of protein conformational dynamics in interaction specificity, allostery, and catalysis.
